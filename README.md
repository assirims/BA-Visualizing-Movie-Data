# Project: Visualizing Movie Data

Complete each section. When you are ready, save your file as a PDF document and submit it

## Step 1: Data Cleanup and Attribute Selection

```
● Clean up any missing information and choose the most important attributes you will
explore further in your visualizations. Done
```
```
● List out the attributes (or variables) you plan to dive further with your visualizations. You
should explore no more than 8 attributes.
○ The Title
○ The production companies
○ The runtime
○ The popularity
○ The genres
○ The release year
○ The Novel based
```
```
● Please refer back to the Data Cleanup course to help you clean up your data.
```
## Step 2: Tableau Visualizations

```
● Please make sure you follow the rubric and include Tableau Dashboards, Stories, and
the appropriate visualizations (small multiples, scatter plot, bar chart, etc..) your reviewer
expects your visualizations to contain. Remember: You need one Dashboard for every
question (Q1-Q4) and in addition, you also need one Story, pertaining to a question of
your choosing.
● Attach your visualizations as Tableau Workbooks in a zip file along with this report.
```
IMPORTANT: Please upload the workbooks to Tableau Public to allow reviewers to access
your workbooks. Note that simply saving your file as a “.twbx” is not enough to allow all
reviewers to access. Instructions on how to do this.

## Step 3: Questions

```
● Answer the following questions. Refer to your online visualizations to back up your
answers:
○ Question 1: How have movie genres changed over time?
■ The producing of movies has been increasing dramatically. In fact, the
number of movies for each genre reaches eighty-seven in 2015, in
contrast to at most ten movies for each genre from 1960 till 1975.
■ Moreover, drama movies are usually the most produced movies across all
genres followed by comedy movies. However, other genres such as
action, adventure, and science fiction movies are the most popular genres
with respect to average popularity.
```
```
○ Question 2: How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and
Paramount Pictures?
■ Universal Pictures appears to have the highest runtime and average
popularity. However, in term of novelty, Paramount Pictures has the
highest runtime and average popularity.
■ Universal Pictures produces the highest number of movies in genres such
as action, animation, documentary, and family. On the other hand,
Paramount Pictures produces movies more than other companies in
genres such as adventure and drama.
```
```
○ Question 3: How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not
based on novels?
■ Novel-base movies appears to be often the most popular movies across
genres especially when the novel is among the bestseller ones. However,
some genres such as documentary are usually not base on novels.
```
```
● What is your additional question that you proposed? What is the answer? How did you
come up with this question?
■ One question that I would proposed is what are the common attributes
among the most popular movies.
■ The answer can be extracted from looking to data about genres, novel
base, and so.
■ The question is inspired from question 2 and 3 above.
